# Market Ready Painting

This website was bootstrapped with Create-React-App, server hosting provided by Firebase. Styling and UI built with Bulma. Email services provided by EmailJS.

## Notes

In order for the email service to function properly, you must create an account with EmailJS and setup your own template and service ID within their dashboard. This
is a simple process that takes only a few minutes. Once created, you'll need to replace `SERVICE_ID` and `TEMPLATE_ID` with their respective strings from the EmailJS 
dashboard. This connects the website's form to EmailJS, and forwards the form data to your desired email address (configurable within EmailJS).
